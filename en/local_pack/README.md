# Local pack

We have developed and published to [GitHub]({{ book["contest.local_pack.url"] }}) a pack for developing C++ and Python strategies locally.
It includes a set of libraries and files sufficient to develop and test a strategy on your computer.

You may download it with the following command ([Git]({{ book["git.url"] }}) required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hftbattle/hftbattle.git
```
